            My internship this past summer was at
            <a href="https://www.gentex.com">Gentex Corporation.</a> 
            This company is most known for their full-display
            mirrors (FDM) but they are actively involved in other areas of technology as well. Starting on the green
            team, I was involved in soldering and partially cross-sections, to gain practical skills that can assist
            me during my time there. Later on, I transitioned into bench-testing to gain skills in electronic testing
            and troubleshooting. At first, I tested FDM's, finding any issues that may occur by simulating it in a
            working environment. If a problem occurred, I would go back and look at documentation of the mirrors as
            well as the schematics to try and find the cause of it. Because I was initially given older models,
            majority of the time it was due to old electronics, and it was as simple as swapping out and soldering in
            newer board components. Later on, I was involved in a project that involved testing a Switch-Mode Power
            Supply (SMPS) board with multiple SMPS units to find a suitable replacement for future designs. (Note that
            the board seen in the picture is not the actual board, it is an evaluation board from TI. Gentex used
            this board initially to give us a better understanding of SMPS's before we were brought onto the actual
            project. I can't show the actual board we used in testing, but I would be happy to discuss about it and
            how we tested!) This experience gave me insights into the practical challenges of selecting components for
            electronic designs, and also gave me an appreciation for the immense amount of testing that goes into each
            product to ensure functionality. After the team finished initial rounds of testing; we were then brought
            in for transient analysis of the SMPS board. Similarly to before, my role was to find and document any
            issues found. <br />
            Near the end of my internship, I was brought into troubleshoot a newer more complex FDM towards the end of
            my internship. Because this model was rather new, I was led by a full-time electrical engineer that works
            there. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the product and its components. Overall, I believe
            my first internship at Gentex provided me with a good foundation in electronics, testing, and troubleshooting,
            all of which are valuable in this field.

        A future project I want to do is turning a Wii into a portable hand-held device. I plan on making two iterations of this, once
        by trimming the Wii board itself and designing my own 3D printed board, and secondly to create a handheld device with a 
        Raspberry Pi. For the first iteration, I think by trimming the board and implementing some electronics, it will provide a good
        experience working with circuit boards, getting more familiar with the elements on the board. While the Raspberry Pi won't be 
        able to run the games as well, it will provide a better learning experience when it comes to programming. The video to the 
        right inspired me to try something like this out myself. If I succeed in doing this, I may even try to branch out and
        make other emulated hand-held devices.
