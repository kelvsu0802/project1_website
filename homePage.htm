        <p>Howdy! My name is Kelvin Su, a junior in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University-College Station. My journey in the realm
            of computer engineering began with admiring my parents. My dad was an electrical engineer, and my mom was in Computer
            Science, and as a result I've always been intrigued by the intersection of hardware and software. I always aim to gain
            some understanding of the intricacies that make our digital world work seamlessly. Being a student at Texas A&M, I've
            been able to engage in a curriculum that hones my technical skills, but also fosters a collaborative mindset. From simply
            learning the basics to designing circuits, I've found every challenge a fun opportunity to learn and grow. I try to stay
            updated on the latest advancements in the computer engineering to stay updated in the ever-changing field of computer 
            engineering. Predictably, my hobbies involves dabbling in electronics. Whether it be experimenting with microcontrollers, soldering
            components together, or simply learning a new skill in the realm of electronics, I find the joy in the hands-on exploration.
            It also doubles as a good learning experience for my classes in university. More recently, I've been interested in teaching
            myself C and utilizing that with an Arduino, building small-scale fun projects. I take a online course unrelated to my 
            university, and I've found it quite fun. It helps that because my university teaches C++ at a high level, the transition to 
            C hasn't been too difficult. My hopes in this is that I will develop a stronger understanding of microcontrollers, and can 
            move onto more professional/advanced microcontrollers so that I can create bigger projects.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I enjoy playing ping-pong, going on walks, trying out new restaurants (especially small family ran ones!), 
            and am an avid gamer. In fact, I specifically built my keyboard, and plan on learning a little bit of woodworking so I 
            can make myself a desk, all to create for myself my ideal setup to game on. If anyone reading this also enjoys to game, 
            I'd love to play, please contact me using the information below! Anyways, that's it from me, please feel free to look around! </p>
